# 0.5 - Introduction to the compiler, linker, and libraries
The material makes note of *makefiles as a file that describes how to build a program (e.g. which files to compile and link or otherwise process in various ways)*, but they are not part of the core C++ language. HOWEVER, they are a big part of ROS and should be learned elsewhere.

# 0.6 - IDEs
I'm using Visual Studio Code. Follow [these instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp) to install the extension and compiler.
